This is a very simple, barebones Content Managament System for an ecommerce webshop-to-be.
The project is based on an MS SQL Server database using the Entity Framework code-first approach.
You can perform basic CRUD operations regarding website users, products and their categories.
The homepage shows a random assortment of 9 products from the database and you have the ability to view every product and their categories separately.

To try out simply run the solution, add the initial migration and update the database.

When debugging use preseeded login details below to access the respective user's features:

-ADMIN- (Gives access to all of the features)

user: admin@admin.com
pass: Admin123

-USER- (Simple demo of the site, can view homepage, products and categories or register a new user yourself.)

user: user@user.com
pass: User123
